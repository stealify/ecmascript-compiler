# ecmascript-compiler
ECMAScript Compilers - Rollup, Closure, Typescript, Babel, ESLint, lebab, Webpack, SystemJS, StealJS

This Repo Handels the @stealify/ecmascript-compiler Development dependencies not the compiler it self the Stealify Compiler is a Cloud Only Product Propertary Closed Source which uses a Hugh a F... Data Source of Many Petra Byte of Code Analyzes Data.

## Usage
At present this is not directly used else where 

## Goals 
- Offer Better Code Quality Distrubtions of Dependencies 
- build from the Original Code Projects which got 1000+ Maintainers with code quality assurance.
- Establish and Enforce the Stealify Module Standard on our own Dependencies even if they are coded by 3th party.
- handle licenses correct
- handle types coreect
- handle documentation correct
- take anything into a Stealify ECMAScript Module (Is a Serialized JSONArray containing code and meta data to load that code with its dependencies)
- Establish a Standard for ECMAScript Modules with static loading instructions. Should be able to Produce Any Module Formart from that serializeable Data.

## Already Archived Goals
- up to 30x Faster Load Times on NodeJS via engine Optimized Code Parsing with lazy loading 
- up to 100x Faster Load Times on GraalJS as also Making GraalJS More NodeJS Compatible. 
- Deno is not tested but faster load time can also be expected as also solves all the compat issues
- Creates a Modular Extend Able System to Code once and Produce Modules for any Target.
- Raises Code Quality by Design.
